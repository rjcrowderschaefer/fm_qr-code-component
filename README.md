## Overview

I was provided with mobile and desktop design mockups (screengrabs) and a jpg qr code. The task was to create the page to align as close as possible with the screengrabs.

## My process

I first started with the index.html file to make sure the base code framework was set up properly to include symantic elements with class and id names that clearly indicate the content being represented. From there, I moved to the styles.css file to design the page itself. I first centered the .card div horizontally and vertically on the page before moving over to the h1 and p class styling and adding/sizing the qr image.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first Frontend Mentor challenge and it was a nice quick project to get used to the workflow and requirements. Through this exercise I was able to practice my implementation of CSS Flexbox, was reintroduced to the importance of symantic HTML and using rem units instead of px when working with font sizes in order to make the page as responsive as possible.
